# python music

exloring capabilities of different python music modules
with a emphasis on pitch control

install dependencies with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## USE
* numpy - I want to do math and I will not be contrained by the 12 EDO assumption of higher level libraries
* pygame - overkill for just audio use, but is mature, maintained, and has features such as directly playing numpy, async, and multiple channels



## DO NOT USE
* pytuning - example code errros.  not maintained.
* simpleaudio - example code errors.  not maintained.
* pydub - a newer way to play and work with audio files.  Seems nice, but I want something with more of a track record
