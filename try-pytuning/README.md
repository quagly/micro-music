# trying out pytuning

What does it do?

Not sure, didn't get to try it as it errors on the first example from the docs

```
from pytuning.scales import create_edo_scale
edo_12_scale = create_edo_scale(12)
```

error is
```
AttributeError: module 'sympy' has no attribute 'power'
```

old issue logged but not fixed
```

```

## Conclusion

Don't use
